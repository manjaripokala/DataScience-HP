These are couple of my favorite quotes on data science. I strongly believe that data science and analytics truly hold the key to some of the most challenging and interesting problems in modern day. It can either be an unimaginable scientific marvel or a lifesaving medical breakthrough. Every set of data that exists yearns to tell a story, and we as data scientists need to identify the story & present it to the world.

It's been a year at HP, as a Data Analyst in the Media Analytics group. My goal here is to share some of the interesting statistical & machine learning approaches I encountered & adapted in data analytics.

Digital Campaigning
===================
Our primary goal as a data science team is to cater to digital marketing campaigns for various HP flagship products. Analyzing the trends and behavior of existing visitors, we strive to gather a set of audience that would yield the highest conversion rate. We achieve this by incorporating several known data modelling techniques, and occasionally survey novel proposals.
